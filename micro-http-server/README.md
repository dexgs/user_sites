# The ÂµHTTP server
This is a fork of https://github.com/philippludwig/micro-http-server
which I have expanded to suit my own purposes. Currently, you MUST run
this behind a reverse proxy if you plan on exposing it to the open internet
as it doesn't impose any limits on the size of incoming data and also
doesn't support HTTPS.
